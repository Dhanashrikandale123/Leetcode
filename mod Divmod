One of the built-in functions of Python is divmod, which takes two arguments a and b and returns a tuple containing the quotient of a/b first and then the remainder a.

For example:

>>> print divmod(177,10)
(17, 7)
Here, the integer division is 177/10 => 17 and the modulo operator is 177%10 => 7.

Input Format
The first line contains the first integer, , and the second line contains the second integer, .

Output Format
Print the result as described above.

Sample Input

177
10
Sample Output

17
7
(17, 7)


code:
a,b=int(input()),int(input())
res,res1=a//b,a%b
print(res,res1,divmod(a,b),sep="\n")
